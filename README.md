# React Multi-handled Range Slider Prototype

In the project root, you can run `npm start` to get a demo on `localhost:3000`.

## Project structure

- `src/App.js` - component containing the code that runs a demo of the prototype, but _no core logic_

- `src/Slider.js` - component containing nearly all the logic for the slider component

- `src/render/` - directory containing components used for rendering with little to no logic

- `src/styles/` - directory containing css files for styling
