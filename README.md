# React Multi-handled Range Slider Prototype

Working demo: https://colesam.github.io/react-range-slider-proto/

For a local instance you can run `npm start` in the project's root to get a demo on `localhost:3000`.

See [this article](https://objectpartners.com/2021/02/16/how-to-make-a-multi-handled-range-input/) for an explanation of how this slider works.

## Project structure

- `src/App.js` - component containing throwaway code that runs a demo of the prototype, but _no core logic_

- `src/Slider.js` - component containing nearly all the logic for the slider component

- `src/render/` - directory containing components used for rendering with little to no logic

- `src/styles/` - directory containing css files for styling
